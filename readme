Description:
This program is used to insert a batch of records to mysql db. 
It support multiple-range, multiple-range means the items in all ranges is one-to-one correspondence. 
The example is below:
student_id: range(120~199)
sort_order: range(1~80)
status: 1
then we will execute below sql:
insert into table_student set student_id=120,sort_order=1,status=1;
insert into table_student set student_id=121,sort_order=2,status=1;
insert into table_student set student_id=122,sort_order=3,status=1;
...
insert into table_student set student_id=199,sort_order=80,status=1;
